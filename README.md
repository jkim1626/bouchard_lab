new_data: normalized metabolite intensities with relative concentrations

test_0: preliminary stage of test data created by Olivia

test_1: stage 1 of test data created by create_spectrum_1.py (No noise, only ratios of metabolites)

test_2: stage 2 of test data created by create_spectrum_2.py (Varying noise, no added peaks)

test_3: stage 3 of test data created by create_spectrum_3.py (Varying noise, varying number of added peaks)
